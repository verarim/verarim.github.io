I conduct and lead research activities at the intersection of security, privacy, and AI. Our team [explores](#publications) data analytics in network intrusion and malware detection, privacy-enhancing technologies, and trustworthiness of data-driven AI in the wider ICT context. The driving force behind my work is examining the optimal role of technology, particularly AI, in our society while balancing its benefits and challenges. In this age of surveillance and uncontrolled data collection and inference, I am committed to developing a comprehensive understanding, forming reasonable expectations, and devising effective strategies to mitigate the risks of applied AI.

Beyond academic research, our team is committed to sharing scientific knowledge through direct collaboration with industry. We work with companies seeking practical guidance on how to safely and securely leverage modern AI technologies, such as deep learning, foundation models, and large language models, to meet their needs.
